# SLR-202: Software System Modelling and Design
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course SLR-202 at Télécom Paris 

Objectives
 The objective of this course is to learn the basics of the most popular standard in industry to model software architectures: UML. In the scope of a simple and generic design process, this course covers
(i) the modelling of the functional requirements of a software application,
(ii) the design of software architectures with object oriented paradigms,
and (iii) the behavioural modelling of software applications.

Syllabus This course will address the following topics:
- Requirements specifications, expressed with use case diagrams.
- Object oriented architecture modelling, based on class diagrams refined with well-known design patterns from the Gang Of Four (GOF).
- Interactions modelling with sequence diagrams.
- Behavioural models using state-chart diagrams.
This course also proposes a modelling approach, linking together these different UML2 diagrams, and following the recommendations that were standardised as a consensus in industry. Students will have to apply this modelling approach on a project using tools.
